Browser version for Spatie Ray.
This lightweight client wrote with raw PHP and jQuery.\
It uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for no-F5 effect :)) and works almost like proprietary Spatie client. 

For Yii2:\
Place file ray.php into root Yii2 project dir and set your host in it (I run this web client on ray.test locally)\
Also in root Yii2 project dir:\
composer require spatie/yii-ray --dev

See Ray docs for using with Laravel and other: \
